Installation
==============

| To get started, you first have to install Breaker.
| This is done the same way that you install any other plugin.

1. Download the latest ``Breaker.jar`` from `Spigot <https://www.spigotmc.org/>`_
2. Breaker depends on `MythicLib <https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?pages/official-mythiclib-dev/>`_, so make sure you get the latest dev build of that.
3. Drop both jar files into your servers plugin folder.

You should now be ready to start :ref:`configuring <doc_quickstart_configuration>`.
